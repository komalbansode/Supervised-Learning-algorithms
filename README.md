# Supervised Algorithms in Machine Learning

## Credit Risk Analysis and Modeling Project done in Python.


***A supervised learning algorithm learns from labeled training data, helps you to predict outcomes for unforeseen data. ]
The various supervised algorithms are:***
- Regression
- K-Nearest neighbours(KNN)
- Support Vector Machine(SVM)

In this Project  we have applied various supervised learning algorithms on the data so as to identify the eligibility of the  customer for loan and also developed the model on the basis of best performance out of all the algorithms.


***CREDIT RISK CASE STUDY â€“ PROBLEM STATEMENT***

Credit Risk:
Credit risk is nothing but the default in payment of any loan by the borrower. In Banking sector this is an important factor to be considered before approving the loan of an applicant.


Problem Statement:

About Company:

Dream Housing Finance company deals in all home loans. They have presence across all urban, semi urban and rural areas. Customer first apply for home loan after that company validates the customer eligibility for loan.

Problem:

Company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application form. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others. To automate this process, they have given a problem to identify the customers segments, those are eligible for loan amount so that they can specifically target these customers. Here they have provided a partial data set.
